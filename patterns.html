  PATTERN: MODAL

      <h1 id="modal">Modal</h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="span12">
          <div class='alert alert-info'>
            <u><strong>Data Attributes</strong></u>
            <p>
              Below are some notes about <em>some</em> of the available data attributes.
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt>data-pat-modal-position<dt>
              <dd>
                Optional, the default being <em>center middle</em>.
                <br /><br />
                In the form <em>&lt;horizontal position&gt; &lt;vertical position&gt;</em>,
                where "&lt;horizontal position&gt;" is one of <em>center</em>, <em>left</em>,
                <em>right</em>, and where "&lt;vertical position&gt;" is one of
                <em>middle</em>, <em>top</em>, <em>bottom</em>. Ex: "center middle"
                <br /><br />
                If you wanted to position a modal on the left side of the page,
                but didn't want it positioned 0px from the left, you'd want to use
                the <em><strong>data-pat-modal-margin</strong></em> option.
              <dd>

              <dt>data-pat-modal-margin</dt>
              <dd>
                This is ultimately an integer value. Defined through a data attribute
                it must be an integer value -- but defined through javascript, it
                can be an integer value or a function that takes no arguments and
                returns an integer value.
                <br /><br />
                The integer value represents a unit amount in pixels for a margin
                on all 4 sides of the modal dialog.

                  identities? That coat costs more than your house! Well,
                  obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par
                  example. You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely.

                  Come on!</p>


                <p>No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! Michael
                  was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called
                  Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant
                  was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's
                  Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu.
                  Do not order the Skip's Scramble. Look, you are playing
                  adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing
                  grab-ass in the shower. I just don't want him to point out my
                  cracker ass in front of Ann. How about a turtle? I've always
                  loved those leathery little snappy faces. I believe you will
                  find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing! So
                  we don't get dessert?</p>


                <p>I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue
                  Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? Te quiero.
                  English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. We need
                  a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top
                  that. (They never did.) Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year
                  older…and a year closer to death. Buster: Oh yeah, I guess
                  that's kind of funny. I am going to my spin class. I thought
                  you had vertigo. Turns out he ended up getting too friendly
                  with the teddy bear.</p>


                <p>And although the intervention didn't work, it turned into
                  one of the Bluth family's better parties. Te quiero. English,
                  please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. I call it Tricks –-
                  wait for it – Around The Office. The only thing I found in

                  crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp.
                  Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd
                  gone in head first, like Pete Rose. I know she's a brownish
                  area! With points! And I love her! Let me give that oatmeal
                  some brown sugar. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw
                  ca caw, caw ca caw! It's as Ann as the nose on plain's
                  face.</p>


                <p>Let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar. So, what do you
                  say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama
                  Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. Say goodbye to THESE!</p>


                <p>So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing
                  me! Don't call my escorts whores.</p>


                <p>Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual
                  intercourse. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed
                  libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Ah
                  coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. One for the ladies.
                  Make love in your *own* hand, Mother! Fried cheese… with club
                  sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with
                  spicy club sauce. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn
                  shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club
                  sauce. I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl
                  this town has ever seen.</p>


                <p>I don't care if it takes from now till the end of
                  Shrimpfest. You might wanna lean away from that fire since
                  you're soaked in alcohol.</p>

                <p>So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing
                  me! Don't call my escorts whores.</p>


                <p>Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual
                  intercourse. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed
                  libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Ah
                  coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. One for the ladies.
                  Make love in your *own* hand, Mother! Fried cheese… with club
                  sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with
                  spicy club sauce. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn
                  shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club

                  this town has ever seen.</p>


                <p>I don't care if it takes from now till the end of
                  Shrimpfest. You might wanna lean away from that fire since
                  you're soaked in alcohol.</p>

                <p>Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on
                  this boardwalk than anywhere on the OC? You stay on top of
                  her, Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard. Are you aware
                  of this? Coming soon. Indeed. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are
                  you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden
                  identities? That coat costs more than your house! Well,
                  obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par
                  example. You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely.
                  Oh…yeah…the guy in the…the $4,000 suit is holding the
                  elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months.
                  Come on!</p>


                <p>No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! Michael
                  was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called
                  Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant
                  was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's
                  Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu.
                  Do not order the Skip's Scramble. Look, you are playing
                  adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing
                  grab-ass in the shower. I just don't want him to point out my
                  cracker ass in front of Ann. How about a turtle? I've always
                  loved those leathery little snappy faces. I believe you will
                  find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing! So
                  we don't get dessert?</p>


                <p>I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue
                  Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? Te quiero.
                  English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. We need
                  a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top
                  that. (They never did.) Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year
                  older…and a year closer to death. Buster: Oh yeah, I guess
                  that's kind of funny. I am going to my spin class. I thought
                  you had vertigo. Turns out he ended up getting too friendly
                  with the teddy bear.</p>


                <p>And although the intervention didn't work, it turned into
                  one of the Bluth family's better parties. Te quiero. English,
                  please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. I call it Tricks –-
                  wait for it – Around The Office. The only thing I found in
                  the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat
                  that, did you?</p>


                <p>I believe you will find the dessert to be both engrossing
                  and high-grossing! So we don't get dessert? Well excuse me
                  for liking the way they frame my junk! Did you know that more
                  frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than
                  anywhere in the OC? Buster, what are you doing with mother's
                  rape-horn?</p>

                  crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp.
                  Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd
                  gone in head first, like Pete Rose. I know she's a brownish
                  area! With points! And I love her! Let me give that oatmeal
                  some brown sugar. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw
                  ca caw, caw ca caw! It's as Ann as the nose on plain's
                  face.</p>

                piece of content.
            </p>

                is entering text that they'd like to match against content in
                their website, and the second is when a user is point-and-click

                A request to a service that returns a JSON file is used to gather
                information by the Select2 widget. The service understands a few
                parameters that get past to it in order to return the relevant
                set of data based on the query and location within the query results

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
