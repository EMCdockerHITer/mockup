              Below are some notes about <em>some</em> of the available pattern
              options. These are options that will be placed in the data-pat-modal attribute.
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt>position<dt>
              <dd>
                Optional, the default being <em>center middle</em>.
                <br /><br />
                In the form <em>&lt;horizontal position&gt; &lt;vertical position&gt;</em>,
                where "&lt;horizontal position&gt;" is one of <em>center</em>, <em>left</em>,
                <em>right</em>, and where "&lt;vertical position&gt;" is one of
                <em>middle</em>, <em>top</em>, <em>bottom</em>. Ex: "center middle"
                <br /><br />
                If you wanted to position a modal on the left side of the page,
                but didn't want it positioned 0px from the left, you'd want to use
                the <em><strong>margin</strong></em> option.
              <dd>

              <dt>margin</dt>
              <dd>
                This is ultimately an integer value. Defined through a data attribute
                it must be an integer value -- but defined through javascript, it
                can be an integer value or a function that takes no arguments and
                returns an integer value.
                <br /><br />
                The integer value represents a unit amount in pixels for a margin
                on all 4 sides of the modal dialog.

                <p>No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! Michael
                  was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called
                  Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant
                  was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's
                  Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu.
                  Do not order the Skip's Scramble. Look, you are playing
                  adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing
                  grab-ass in the shower. I just don't want him to point out my
                  cracker ass in front of Ann. How about a turtle? I've always
                  loved those leathery little snappy faces. I believe you will
                  find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing! So
                  we don't get dessert?</p>


                <p>I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue
                  Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? Te quiero.
                  English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. We need
                  a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top
                  that. (They never did.) Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year
                  older…and a year closer to death. Buster: Oh yeah, I guess
                  that's kind of funny. I am going to my spin class. I thought
                  you had vertigo. Turns out he ended up getting too friendly
                  with the teddy bear.</p>


                <p>And although the intervention didn't work, it turned into
                  one of the Bluth family's better parties. Te quiero. English,

                  anywhere in the OC? Buster, what are you doing with mother's

                  crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp.
                  Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd
                  gone in head first, like Pete Rose. I know she's a brownish
                  area! With points! And I love her! Let me give that oatmeal
                  some brown sugar. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw
                  ca caw, caw ca caw! It's as Ann as the nose on plain's
                  face.</p>


                <p>Let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar. So, what do you
                  say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama
                  Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. Say goodbye to THESE!</p>


                <p>So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing
                  me! Don't call my escorts whores.</p>


                <p>Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual
                  intercourse. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed

                  coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. One for the ladies.
                  Make love in your *own* hand, Mother! Fried cheese… with club

                  was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called
                  Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant
                  was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's
                  Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu.
                  Do not order the Skip's Scramble. Look, you are playing
                  adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing
                  grab-ass in the shower. I just don't want him to point out my
                  cracker ass in front of Ann. How about a turtle? I've always
                  loved those leathery little snappy faces. I believe you will
                  find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing! So
                  we don't get dessert?</p>


                <p>I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue
                  Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? Te quiero.
                  English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. We need
                  a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top
                  that. (They never did.) Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year
                  older…and a year closer to death. Buster: Oh yeah, I guess
                  that's kind of funny. I am going to my spin class. I thought
                  you had vertigo. Turns out he ended up getting too friendly
                  with the teddy bear.</p>


                <p>And although the intervention didn't work, it turned into
                  one of the Bluth family's better parties. Te quiero. English,
                  please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. I call it Tricks –-
                  wait for it – Around The Office. The only thing I found in
                  the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat
                  that, did you?</p>


                <p>I believe you will find the dessert to be both engrossing
                  and high-grossing! So we don't get dessert? Well excuse me
                  for liking the way they frame my junk! Did you know that more
                  frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than
                  anywhere in the OC? Buster, what are you doing with mother's
                  rape-horn?</p>


                <p>I believe you will find the dessert to be both engrossing
                  and high-grossing! So we don't get dessert? Look at us,
                  crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp.
                  Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd
                  gone in head first, like Pete Rose. I know she's a brownish
                  area! With points! And I love her! Let me give that oatmeal
                  some brown sugar. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw
                  ca caw, caw ca caw! It's as Ann as the nose on plain's
                  face.</p>


                <p>Let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar. So, what do you
                  say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama
                  Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. Say goodbye to THESE!</p>


                <p>So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing
                  me! Don't call my escorts whores.</p>


                <p>Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual
                  intercourse. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed
                  libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Ah
                  coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. One for the ladies.
                  Make love in your *own* hand, Mother! Fried cheese… with club
                  sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with
                  spicy club sauce. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn
                  shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club
                  sauce. I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl
                  this town has ever seen.</p>


                <p>I don't care if it takes from now till the end of
                  Shrimpfest. You might wanna lean away from that fire since
                  you're soaked in alcohol.</p>
