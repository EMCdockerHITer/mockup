            <h1>Title 1</h1>
            <p>Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. You said
              spanking. It walked on my pillow! How about a turtle? I've always
              loved those leathery little snappy faces. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw,
              caw ca caw, caw ca caw. Chaw-chee, chaw-chee chaw-chee! Coo coo
              ca cha!</p>
            <h2>Title 1.1</h2>
            <p>Ah coodle doodle do Caw ca caw, caw ca caw. Butterscotch!</p>
            <h2>Title 1.2</h2>
            <p>That's not what I WAS thinking. Yeah, well, have you seen the
              new Mustang? You could hump that hood.</p>
            <h3>Title 1.1.1</h3>
            <p>Want a lick? Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was
              a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist.</p>
            <h3>Title 1.1.2</h3>
            <p>The world's first analrapist. Sister's my new mother, Mother.
              And is it just me or is she looking hotter?</p>
            <h3>Title 1.1.3</h3>
            <p>Butterscotch! Want a lick? And I wouldn't just lie there, if
              that's what you're thinking.</p>
            <h2>Title 1.3</h2>
            <p>I see you've wasted no time in filling my seat hole. There are
              dozens of us! DOZENS! Sweet old thing. Only two of those words
              describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me.</p>
            <h1>Title 2</h1>
            <p>You boys know how to shovel coal? Don't worry, these young
              beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. I thought the two of
              us could talk man-on-man.</p>
            <h1>Title 3</h1>
            <p>You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are
              wet. Don't leave your Uncle T-bag hanging.  What's up,
              fizz-ellas.

              <p>I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it?
                Everybody dance… NOW. Actually, that was a box of Oscar's
                legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky
                weed. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? We
                need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'. O-kay, who'd like
                a banger in the mouth? </p>

            <fieldset>

              <p>Don't ask "Can I"… ask "I Can!" Do you have any idea how often
                you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I used it in the
                Jacuzzi. It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the
                future. I've been in the film business for a while but I just
                can't seem to get one in the can. Oh, I don't have any drugs
                for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car?
                Turn this skiff around! </p>

              <p>I didn't get into this business to please sophomore Tracy
                Schwartzman, so… onward and upward. On… Why, Tracy?! Why?!! So
                maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me!
